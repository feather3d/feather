Feather
=======

3d polygon modeller based off of Wings3d

Introduction
---------------
Feather is 3d polygon modelling application based on Wings3d. Feather has a C++ core and Qt5 QML interface which eliminates issues that Wings has due to the Erlang language that it uses. Feather is currently only targeted for the Linux OS but others could be added later.

Target Features
---------------
Here's a list of features that are the goal for version 1.0.
    * C++ core
    * QtQuick interface
    * Open/Save feather project files
    * Import/Export obj files
    * Full clone of Wings tools for all components (vertex, edge, face and object)
    * Outliner
    * Material Editor
    * UV Editor
    * Integrated Renderer (Mitsuba or Lux?)
    * Support for 3DConnexion SpaceNavigator

Current Status
---------------
Currently Feather is in it's very early stages of development and is pretty much useless. Once the project gets to a point where it's usable (you can open and model, make adjustments and then save your changes) I'll post instructions on how to build and install the application.
